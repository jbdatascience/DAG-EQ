** GAN for MNIST
*** DONE test python code for GAN
CLOSED: [2019-12-10 Tue 16:07]
*** DONE debug DCGAN for julia
CLOSED: [2019-12-10 Tue 16:06]

My experience:
- dropout is very important, use in discriminator
- dropout can be used together with batchnorm
- use bias = false is not required
- the last conv in generator should not be stride=2, but 1, i.e. no scaling
  performed in the last conv
- normalize MNIST to -1,1 instead of 0,1 seems to be very important

** TODO Implement interventional loss

*** TODO use dense GAN for graphical model
- generator
- discriminator

*** TODO implement causal effect inference (compute effect)
- [X] hard intervention
- soft intervention
- multiple interventions

*** TODO implement interventional loss
- random intervention
- compute effect
- discriminator likelyhood

*** related work
Looks like I have to compare against them, so it does not hurt implementing them now.

**** DONE The NOTEARS framework
CLOSED: [2019-12-11 Wed 17:00]
NOTEARS does not seem to recover beyond equivalent class.

I'm at the optimization solver, and currently
- Optim uses autodiff. However, it is slow, and does not seem to solve correctly
- I'm trying something else, like NLopt suite, and this seems to work

***** DONE score metrics
CLOSED: [2019-12-11 Wed 18:09]
And the score seems to be very different when I modify notears's python code with:
- replace 2 * d * d with just the result and gradient of d*d
- the L1 regularizer also matters

***** DONE non-negative box constraint
CLOSED: [2019-12-11 Wed 18:09]

and related: 2*d*d w_est problem

**** meta-transfer
And the +NOTEARS version

**** traditional
- PC
- LiNGRAM
- GES (using FGS)


*** TODO train with interventional loss

** More Ideas on Interventional loss
*** different interventions
- hard do-notation
- hard do-distribution
- soft intervention
- mechanism change

*** Separating interventional distributions
When there are many variables, and many interventions, and the interventional
data might be much less of amount then observational data, it might be
challenging to learn a generative model of the mixture distribution. Thus, we
might consider an extension of this work to seperated unknown interventions.

- we can learn generative models for each of the distribution
- we then use the minimum loss of discriminator to calculate interventional
  loss, i.e. as long as one of the interventional distribution is consistent
  with the random intervention, we accept it.

** TODO supervised re-parametric
Train:
- assume linear gaussian model
- design a new convolution (on graph), probably use GCN
- generate random model
- generate mu and sigma
- train f(mu, sigma)=adjacent_matrix

Open problems:
- conv operator, shared weights
- order of nodes
- generalized reparametric

Inference:
- compute statistics mu and sigma
- f(mu, sigma)

*** TODO Regularizing
- it can reach high accuracy very quickly
- but it seems to overfitting very quickly as well

*** CANCELED negative sampling
CLOSED: [2019-12-12 Thu 16:34]
Use a distance measure, or AIC/BIC score to assign the score for all (or a
sample) graphs, not just the correct graph

*** TODO multi-variate
*** TODO stochastic SGD
- I need more data
- when data is large, I need to batch
- and I need to shuffle the batches as well, for stochastic
*** TODO other models
- different number of hidden units
- different number of layers
- different models, e.g. GCN

*** TODO sharing weights
For generalizing to other number of variables
*** TODO generalizing to other models
- linear + Gaussian
- non-Gaussian, e.g. poisson
- generalized linear
- non-linear


*** Intergrate with (noise-based?) assymetrcis
- For distinguishing equivalent classes
  - but it alrady works very well
- using data other than statistics

*** inside equivalent class
non-Gaussian or non-Linear

- LiNGAM: Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model:
  https://sites.google.com/site/sshimizu06/lingam
- no-linear model: seems to be extension to LiNGAM, do not have a special
  algorithm, still use noise footprint.
